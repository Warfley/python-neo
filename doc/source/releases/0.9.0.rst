Neo 0.9.0 release notes
=======================

[TODO] th October 2020


Group and ChannelView replace Unit and ChannelIndex
---------------------------------------------------



Python 3 only
-------------

We have now dropped support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.5, and for versions of NumPy older than 1.13.
In future, we plan to follow NEP29_ + one year, i.e. we will support Python and NumPy versions
for one year longer than recommended in NEP29. This was `discussed here`_.

Change in default behaviour for grouping channels in IO modules
---------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, when reading multiple related signals (same length, same units) from a file,
some IO classes would by default create a separate, single-channel :class:`AnalogSignal` per signal,
others would combine all related signals into one multi-channel :class:`AnalogSignal`.

From Neo 0.9.0, the default for all IO classes is to create a one multi-channel :class:`AnalogSignal`.
To get the "multiple single-channel signals" behaviour, use::

    io.read(signal_group_mode="split-all")

Other new or modified features
------------------------------

  * added methods :func:`rectify()`, :func:`downsample` and :func:`resample` to :class:`AnalogSignal`
  * :func:`SpikeTrain.merge()` can now merge multiple spiketrains
  * the utility function :func:`cut_block_by_epochs()` gives a new :class:`Block` now
    rather than modifying the block in place.

See all `pull requests`_ included in this release and the `list of closed issues`_.

Bug fixes and improvements in IO modules
----------------------------------------

  * NeoMatlabIO (support for signal annotations)
  * NeuralynxIO (fix handling of empty .nev files)
  * AxonIO (support EDR3 header, fix channel events bug)
  * Spike2IO (fix rounding problem, fix for v9 SON files)
